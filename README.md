<img src="app/icon/Cat_Breed_Classifier.jpg" alt="Cat Breed Classifier" width="300"/>

## Project description
This project aims to classify cat breeds based on their characteristics, using __*neural networks*__.

## Objective of the project
It is a training project to complete the course on machine and deep learning at Mutah University.

## Data used
__Tabular data__ for the characteristics of 10 cat breeds. This is semi-realistic data that was manually collected through ChatGPT's description of the characteristics of these breeds.

Example of data used :

|Breeds |Weight |Length |Fur_length	|Fur_type |Fur_color |Eye_color |Age |Sleep_hours
|:--- |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |---:
|Maine Coon |6.7 |51 |long |heavy |brown |copper |12 |14
|Siamese |5.4 |31 |short |soft |creamy |blue |12 |15
|Manx |3.5 |30 |short/medium |soft |red |blue |15 |15

1412 rows Ã— 9 columns

## Characteristics used in prediction

- Breeds
- Weight
- Length
- Fur Length
- Fur Type
- Fur Color
- Eye Color

5. Turkish Angora
6. Maine Coon
7. Norwegian Forest Cat
8. Manx
9. Japanese Bobtail
10. British Shorthair

## Work stages

1. Data collection
2. Data analysis
3. Data cleaning and transformation
4. Model building (neural networks)
5. Model evaluation
6. Building a user interface

## Results

|||
|:--- |:---:|
|Accuracy | 100% |
|Recall | 1.0 |
|Precision | 1.0 |
|F1-score | 1.0 |
|Confusion Matrix | No data confusion |

## User interface
